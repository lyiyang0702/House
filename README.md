# House
 CMPM 121 Assignment 1


My scene contains a house and a garden. There are some basic furnitures inside the house, like TV sets, sofa, speakers and also our main character stands behind the sofa. Outside of the house, there are some plants and trees as decoration and cars. Other residents of this house are resting in the garden areas with some cute animals. I referenced several photos online to build this scene. The main character is the girl in the house standing behind the sofa who had a knife in her hand.
